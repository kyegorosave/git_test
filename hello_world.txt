I'm adding some text to this because odin sensei told me to. Life update: I'm currently 20 years old
living in Murrieta, CA. I go to the University of California, Santa Cruz. No girlfriend at the moment, it's rough
out here, but I get the job done still. Got like no money right now. All is well in the land of Kye.
